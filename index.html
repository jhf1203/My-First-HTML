        My HTML File is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
        <br>
        Without me, my HTML File is useless. Without my HTML File, I am useless. I must code my HTML File 
        true. I must think more logically than my computer who is only does what it's told. I must give it 
        the right info before he gives me the wrong. I will ...
        <br>
        My HTML File and I know that what counts in development is not the size of our screen, the speed 
        of our WPM, nor the capacity of our hard drive. We know that it is quality that counts. We will 
        deliver quality ...

        My HTML File is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. 
        I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its tags and its 
        abbreviations. I will keep my HTML File clean and readable, even as I am clean and readable. 
        We will become part of each other. We will ...

        Before God, I swear this creed. My HTML File and I are the defenders of my GitHub. 
        We are the masters of our code. We are the saviors of my life.

        So be it, until victory is ours and there is no enemy, but peace!

    <h3>There are a few things you should know about me</h3>

    <ul>
         <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faison,_North_Carolina" target=_blank>I'm from a <i>really</i> small town</a>
         </li>
         <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4ETmpm1hQY" target=_blank> <b>I really like to ski</b></a>
         </li>
        <li>
    <a href="">I like to homebrew!  But I don't have a cool video of that so this link goes nowhere</a>
        </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>I hate to brag, but...</h3>
    
    <p>I'm a pretty good sandwich maker.  Being a father of a very active 1-year-old I've learned to make the most out of every second of 
        free time that I have, and have thus learned how to make a <i>bomb</i> Turkey Sandwich in under five minutes.  Want to learn?</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Retrieve the following things from the fridge:  Turkey, a stick of butter, dijon mustard lettuce, and bacon.</li>
        <li>Retrieve the following things from the spice rack:  Garlic Powder and Herbes De Provence</li>
        <li>Remove two slices of sourdough bread from the bag</li>
        <li>cut two slices of butter from the stick, and then quarter each slice.</li>
        <li>Place each quarter in a "quadrant" of one side of each piece of bread</li>
        <li>Place bread in the microwave and cook for approximately 30 seconds to soften butter</li>
        <li>spread the butter liberally so that both pieces of bread are appropriately slathered on their appropriate side</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the garlic powder and herbes de provence onto the buttered side of the bread to your liking</li>
        <li>Place the butter in the toaster oven butter side up, set to broil</li>
        <li>Remove two pieces of bacon from the packaging, place on a plate, and microwave for three minutes (+/- 30 seconds for thickness)</li>
        <li>Remove the bacon from the microwave and set the plate aside to cool</li>
        <li>Remove the bread from the toaster over.</li>
        <li>Open the cap on the dijon mustard and spread the desired amount on the non-buttered side of each bread slice</li>
        <li>Tear each bacon strip in half (the short way) and place two of each half-size strip on the mustard side of the bread</li>
        <li>Place your desired amount of turkey on top of the bacon on either piece of bread you choose</li>
        <li>Place your desired amount of lettuce (I like two pieces of green leaf lettuce) on top of the turkey</li>
        <li>One piece of bread should only have mustard and bacon showing.  Place this on top of the lettuce on the other bread slice 
            so that the bacon is touching the lettuce</li>
        <li>Place this on the plate you used to cook the bacon, to reduce dish usage, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I also love music!</h3>

    <p>If it were up to me I would always have music playing.  I'm a playlist guy and a record 
        collector/audiophile.  My favorite band of all time is easily <a href="https://jhf1203.github.io/FanPage/" about=_blank>The National</a>.  Here 
        they are performing "The Day I Die" from 2017's record, <i>Sleep Well Beast</i>

    <br> <br>   
        Besides that my interests span many different genres, but some of my favorites are:</p>

    <h3>I'm an animal lover!</h3>

    <p>I've grown up with cats my entire life, currently <a href="https://i.imgur.com/E2wG7ck.png" target=_blank>Stringer</a> lives
        with us.  We adopted him in 2016 as an 8-week old kitten.  I grew up rabbit hunting with my grandfather and his beagles
        so they remain my favorite dogs.  Here is a list of each of my favorite animals by class:
    </p>

    <table>
            <tr>

    <h3>Wellp!</h3>

    <p>I hope you know a bit more about what makes Jim tick.  I'm sure throughout the course you'll learn even more about me, and me 
        about you!</p>
